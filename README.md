## What does it do?
It's just a small windows tray app that performs an http request to the phone's webserver, making it dial a number.

## Why?
I scoured the interwebs looking for something to do this. All I wanted was to be able to copy a phone number and click a button to call someone for work. So I made something to do it!

## How?
Well, you can just grab my pre-compiled .exe. Or grab the .AHK and compile it with your own installed copy of AHK. There's a configuration interface if you right click the tray icon, or you can just edit the configuration ini. Note that the program looks for the configuration .ini file in whatever directory it is started from. Take that, registry.
